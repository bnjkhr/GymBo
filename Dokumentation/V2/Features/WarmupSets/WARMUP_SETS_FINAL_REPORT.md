## 🎯 Feature Overview

### What It Does
Users can automatically add calculated warmup sets to their exercises at the start of a workout. The feature:

1. **Auto-calculates** warmup weights based on working weight
2. **Offers 3 strategies**: Light (3 sets), Moderate (4 sets), Heavy (5 sets)
3. **Persists selection**: User's chosen strategy is remembered
4. **Applies to all exercises**: One tap adds warmup to entire workout
5. **Distinguishes warmup from working sets**: Visual badges and icons

### Warmup Strategies

| Strategy | Sets | Percentages | Example (100kg working) |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Light** | 3 | 40% → 60% → 80% | 40kg → 60kg → 80kg |
| **Moderate** | 4 | 40% → 55% → 70% → 85% | 40kg → 55kg → 70kg → 85kg |
| **Heavy** | 5 | 40% → 50% → 60% → 75% → 90% | 40kg → 50kg → 60kg → 75kg → 90kg |

## 🏗️ Architecture & Implementation

### Data Layer (SwiftData)

#### Schema Changes
**SchemaV4** - Added warmup support:
```swift
// SessionSetEntity
var isWarmup: Bool  // ✅ NEW: Identifies warmup sets
var restTime: TimeInterval?  // ✅ NEW: Rest timer after set
```

**SchemaV5** - Strategy persistence:
```swift
// UserProfileEntity
var warmupStrategy: String?  // ✅ NEW: Last selected strategy
```

#### Migration Status
- ✅ V4 → V5 migration implemented
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ No data loss on upgrade

### Domain Layer

#### Entities
```swift
struct DomainSessionSet {
    let id: UUID
    var weight: Double
    var reps: Int
    var completed: Bool
    var completedAt: Date?
    var orderIndex: Int
    var restTime: TimeInterval?
    var isWarmup: Bool  // ✅ NEW
}
```

#### Business Logic
**WarmupCalculator.swift**: Pure calculation logic
- ✅ Three strategy enums
- ✅ Progressive percentage calculations
- ✅ Minimum weight validation (5kg minimum)
- ✅ 2.5kg increment rounding

**WorkoutStatistics.swift**: Statistics with warmup filtering
- ✅ `includeWarmupSets: Bool` parameter
- ✅ Filters sets: `.filter { $0.completed && (includeWarmupSets || !$0.isWarmup) }`
- ✅ Volume calculations exclude warmup by default
- ✅ PR detection ignores warmup sets

### Presentation Layer

#### UI Components
**CompactSetRow.swift**: Set display with warmup badge
- ✅ Flame icon 🔥 for warmup sets
- ✅ "WARMUP" badge with orange styling
- ✅ Distinct visual appearance

**AddWarmupSetsSheet.swift**: Strategy selection modal
- ✅ Three strategy cards with examples
- ✅ Visual preview of calculated weights
- ✅ Save & apply button
- ✅ Cancel option

#### State Management
**SessionStore.swift**: Core session management
- ✅ `addWarmupSetsBatch()`: Efficient batch operation
- ✅ `completeSet()`: Toggle-based completion
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates (instant feedback)
- ✅ Forced refresh via `currentSession = nil`

**UserProfileStore.swift**: Strategy persistence
- ✅ Saves last selected strategy
- ✅ Pre-selects on next use
- ✅ SwiftData backed

## 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes

### Bug 1: HealthKit Race Condition ⚠️
**Problem**: HealthKit update was overwriting session with stale copy, deleting warmup sets.

**Timeline**:
```
1. Session created (3 sets per exercise)
2. Session saved to DB
3. HealthKit starts in background (captures session copy)
4. Warmup sets added (6 sets per exercise)
5. HealthKit finishes → overwrites with old copy → warmup sets GONE
```

**Solution**: Fetch current session from DB before updating HealthKit ID
```swift
// OLD (broken):
var updatedSession = session  // Stale copy!
updatedSession.healthKitSessionId = healthKitId

// NEW (fixed):
guard var currentSession = try await repository.fetch(id: session.id) else { return }
currentSession.healthKitSessionId = healthKitId  // Uses fresh data
```

**File**: `StartSessionUseCase.swift:119-137`

---

### Bug 2: Set Completion Toggle Mismatch ⚠️
**Problem**: Tapping a set multiple times caused it to flip between completed/not completed.

**Root Cause**:
- Optimistic update: Always set `completed = true`
- UseCase operation: **Toggle** completion state
- Result: Mismatch between UI and DB

**Solution**: Optimistic update now toggles to match UseCase
```swift
// OLD (broken):
updateLocalSet(exerciseId, setId, completed: true)  // Always true

// NEW (fixed):
let currentState = set.completed
updateLocalSet(exerciseId, setId, completed: !currentState)  // Toggle
```

**File**: `SessionStore.swift:196-205`

---

### Bug 3: UI Not Refreshing ⚠️
**Problem**: Tapping warmup set didn't show checkmark immediately.

**Root Cause**: SwiftUI `@Observable` wasn't detecting nested struct changes.

**Solution**: Force UI update by setting to nil first
```swift
// OLD (didn't work):
currentSession = updatedSession

// NEW (works):
currentSession = nil  // Forces SwiftUI to notice change
currentSession = updatedSession
```

**File**: `SessionStore.swift:1036-1038`

---

### Bug 4: Rest Timer Not Starting for Warmup ⚠️
**Problem**: Rest timer didn't start after completing warmup sets.

**Root Cause**: Warmup sets were created without `restTime` property.

**Solution**: Copy `restTime` from first working set
```swift
let workingSetRestTime = exercise.sets.first(where: { !$0.isWarmup })?.restTime

let warmupSet = DomainSessionSet(
    weight: warmupWeight,
    reps: warmupReps,
    restTime: workingSetRestTime,  // ✅ Now has rest time
    isWarmup: true
)
```

**Files**: `SessionStore.swift:551, 615`

## 📝 Known Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Statistics UI Toggle Missing**
   - ✅ Backend supports `includeWarmupSets` parameter
   - ⚠️ UI toggle not yet added to statistics views
   - Impact: Users can't exclude warmup from stats display yet
   - Workaround: Statistics exclude warmup by default
   - Fix: Add toggle to `HeroStatsCard.swift` or settings

2. **No Warmup Editing**
   - Current: Can't edit warmup sets after creation
   - Workaround: Delete workout and restart
   - Future: Add "Remove Warmup Sets" button

3. **Strategy Change After Creation**

## 🎓 Technical Lessons Learned

### 1. SwiftData Relationships Are Order-Sensitive
**Problem**: Warmup sets need to appear BEFORE working sets.  
**Solution**: Use explicit `orderIndex` field, don't rely on array order.

### 2. Async Tasks Can Cause Race Conditions
**Problem**: HealthKit update overwrote session with stale data.  
**Solution**: Always fetch fresh data from DB before updating.

### 3. SwiftUI @Observable Doesn't Detect Nested Changes
**Problem**: Modifying nested structs didn't trigger UI updates.  
**Solution**: Set to `nil` first, then set to new value to force detection.

### 4. Optimistic Updates Must Match Server Logic
**Problem**: UI toggled differently than backend.  
**Solution**: Ensure optimistic update logic mirrors UseCase logic exactly.

### 5. Domain-Driven Design Pays Off
**Benefit**: Warmup calculation logic is pure, testable, and reusable.  
**Result**: Easy to add new strategies without touching UI code.
