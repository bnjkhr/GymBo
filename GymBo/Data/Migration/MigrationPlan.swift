/// Migration Plan for GymBo SwiftData Schema
///
/// **Purpose:**
/// - Define all schema versions
/// - Specify migration stages between versions
/// - Handle data transformation during migrations
///
/// **Migration History:**
/// - V1 (1.0.0): Initial production schema
/// - V2 (2.0.0): Add exerciseId to WorkoutExerciseEntity
///
/// **Usage:**
/// ```swift
/// let container = try ModelContainer(
///     for: schema,
///     migrationPlan: GymBoMigrationPlan.self
/// )
/// ```

    ///
    /// **Changes:**

    ///
    /// **Strategy:**
    /// - Lightweight migration with willMigrate to populate exerciseId
    /// - For existing WorkoutExerciseEntity, copy exercise.id to exerciseId
    /// - If exercise is nil, use a placeholder UUID (these will be cleaned up)
